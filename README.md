# django-omise Django + Omise

Django models for Omise. Currently, we support the following features:

-   Creating a customer
-   Allowing customer to add/delete credit/debit cards
-   Collect payments with new card with the option to keep the card
-   Collect payments with saved card
-   Collect payments with online banking
-   Basic event webhook handler, saving raw data as an Event object
-   3DS pending charges handling

See the [roadmap](#roadmap-and-contributions) for the plan of this project. Contributions are welcome!

### Quick start

---

1. Add "django_omise" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:

```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        "django_omise",
    ]
```

2. Include the django_omise URLconf in your project urls.py like this:

```
    path("payments/", include("django_omise.urls")),
```

3. Add Omise keys and operating mode in settings.py:

```python
OMISE_PUBLIC_KEY = xxxx
OMISE_SECRET_KEY = xxxx
OMISE_LIVE_MODE = True | False
OMISE_CHARGE_RETURN_HOST = localhost:8000

# Optional. The default payment method is credit/debit card only.
# You must specify additional payment methods.
OMISE_PAYMENT_METHODS = [
    "card",
    "internet_banking", # Additional for internet banking
]
```

4. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the Omise models.

5. Add Omise endpoint webhook url `https://www.your-own-domain.com/payments/webhook/`

### Basic usage

---

1. Create an Omise customer from User:

    ```python
    from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
    from django_omise.models.core import Customer

    User = get_user_model()
    user = User.objects.first()
    customer = Customer.get_or_create(user=user)
    ```

2. Add card to Customer

    2.1 With the built-in view (Recommended)

    We have built a basic card collecting view where logged in users can add and remove their cards. Run Django server and visit _/payments/payment_methods/_ to see it in action. You could override the template used in the view by creating a new template in your project's directory _/templates/django_omise/manage_payment_methods.html_.

    2.2 Manually

    ```python
    from django_omise.models.core import Customer
    from django_omise.omise import omise

    omise_token = omise.Token.retrieve(token_id)
    Customer.objects.live().first().add_card(token=omise_token)
    ```

3. Charge a customer (Currently supporting only credit/debit card payment)

    3.1 With the build-in mixin

    This package comes with a built-in mixin, with which you can create a class-based-view and write a few methods to charge a customer. See below for an example:

    ```python
    from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin
    from django_omise.mixins import CheckoutMixin
    from django_omise.models.choices import Currency

    # Your own class-based-view
    class CheckoutView(LoginRequiredMixin, CheckoutMixin):

        template_name = "yourapp/template.html"
        success_url = ...

        def get_charge_details(self):
            return {
                "amount": 100000,
                "currency": Currency.THB,
            }

        def process_charge_and_form(self, charge, form):
            if charge.status in [ChargeStatus.SUCCESSFUL, ChargeStatus.PENDING]:
                # Create new order and attach a charge object
                # And handle form data
                handle_form_data(form.cleaned_data)
    ```

    3.2 Manually

    ```python
    from django_omise.models.choices import Currency, ChargeStatus
    from django_omise.models.core import Customer

    customer = Customer.objects.first()
    card = customer.cards.live().first()

    charge = customer.charge_with_card(
        amount=100000,
        currency=Currency.THB,
        card=card,
    )

    if charge.status == ChargeStatus.SUCCESSFUL:
        # Do something
    elif charge.status == ChargeStatus.FAILED:
        # Do something else
    ```
